# CS3205 Lab 2
## Instructions to run
To run the code use the below command:
```
python CS20B021.py 20020 <inputfile>
```
## Port numbers used
Port number input used for testing is 20020 and above.
A few times with port number 20000 didn't work because a portnumber between 20053 and 20062 was occupied and a server couldn't be created.
If there is ever an error with an occupied portnumber please use another higher port number for running the code.

## Doubts:

* There is a '-f' output filename which isn't necessary.
* LSA files to be stored but can have out of sync issues with different link costs in different LSA packets. Rather update topology with latest links.
* For Dynamic Links - Implement a overall interface to activate multiple nodes, with commands for initiating link changes
* For Run on different systems - No need for inteface like above but instead introduce ip values for nodes. 
* Check if extra cred necessity is to be fulfilled together or individually is sufficient.
